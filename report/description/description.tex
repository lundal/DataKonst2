The assignment was to improve the implementation from the previous exercise with
a pipeline instead of the datapath, and implement the optimizations that we
wanted. This was to be tested on the FPGA onboard a MicroBlaze-based embedded
system.

\subsection{Requirements}
The processor should include a 5-stage pipeline, and otherwise follow the
requirements from the previous exercise. This includes using a limited MIPS
instruction set.

\subsection{Suggestions}
It was suggested that we followed the architecture presented by Patterson and
Hennessy, as supplied in \ref{fig:suggestedArchitecture}.

\subsection{Supplied material}
\begin{itemize}
\item Communication Framework -  Providing an interface towards the embedded system
\item VHDL Components - Register File, ALU and Adder
\item Test Program - For verification of design
\end{itemize}
